[![Rust](https://github.com/drewwalton19216801/cube3d/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/drewwalton19216801/cube3d/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

A 3D cube renderer with per-pixel lighting using Rust and the Druid GUI framework.  This fork has been modified to display a [csgrs](https://github.com/timschmidt/csgrs) CSG.

## Overview

`cube3d` is a Rust application that renders a rotating 3D cube with per-pixel lighting for accurate shading effects. It demonstrates fundamental 3D graphics concepts such as transformation matrices, rasterization, depth buffering, and lighting calculations without relying on a dedicated graphics library like OpenGL or Vulkan.

## Features

- **Per-Pixel Lighting:** Implements per-pixel lighting for realistic shading across the cube's surface.
- **World Space Lighting:** Displays the light position in world space.
- **Wireframe Mode:** Renders the cube in wireframe mode.
- **Rotating 3D Cube:** Continuously rotates a 3D cube around its axis.
- **Debug Mode:** Displays frames per second (FPS), rotation angle, light position, and program information.
- **Mouse Zoom:** Zoom the cube in and out using the mouse wheel.
- **Mouse Rotation:** Rotate the cube around its axis using the mouse.
- **Mouse Translation:** Translate the cube using the mouse.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust:** Make sure you have Rust installed. You can download it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- **Cargo:** Comes bundled with Rust for package management and building.
- **Linux only:** On Linux (and probably other *NIX platforms other than macOS), GTK+3 is required. On Ubuntu-based distros, `sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev` will suffice.

## Installing

Install cube3d with cargo:

```bash
cargo install cube3d
```

## Building

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drewwalton19216801/cube3d.git
cd cube3d
```

Build the project using Cargo:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

This will compile the project in release mode for optimal performance.

## Running

Run the application with Cargo, or if you installed it above, run directly:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

```bash
cube3d
```

## Help Text

To display help text, press the `h` key during program operation.

## Enabling Debug Mode

To enable debug mode and display additional information, press the `d` key during program operation.

## Pausing/Resuming

To pause/resume the program, press the `p` key during program operation.

## Resetting Zoom and Translation

To reset the cube's position and zoom level to their defaults, press the `r` key during program operation.

## Quitting

To quit the program, press the `q` key during program operation.

## How It Works
* **3D Transformations:** Applies rotation matrices to simulate cube rotation around the X and Y axes.
* **Rasterization:** Converts 3D triangles into pixels on the 2D screen.
* **Depth Buffering:** Implements a Z-buffer to handle occlusion of faces.
* **Per-Pixel Lighting:** Calculates lighting at each pixel by interpolating normals and positions, providing smooth shading.

## Dependencies

The project uses the following crates:

* `druid`: A data-first Rust-native UI design toolkit.

These dependencies are specified in `Cargo.toml` and will be automatically fetched when you build the project.

## Compatibility

`cube3d` is cross-platform and has been tested on Linux and Windows, and should also work on macOS.
